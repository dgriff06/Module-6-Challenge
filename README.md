# Module-6-Challenge

## Project Description

This notebook contains my analysus of the housing rental market data for San Francisco (2010-2016).

I used the pandas library along with hvplot and pathlib to import the housing data from 3 csv files, before cleaning and ultimately
plotting the data using on various graphs. 

The key challenges I faced were properly sorting the data so that I could build data frames with the correct information, and passing 
the correct parameters so that I could plot the information correctly.

## How to install and run the project

This code can be implemented so long as the correct libraries (pandas, hvplot, pahtlin) are installed to the user's enviroment. These can be
done using pip install or conda install

Once the environment is set up correctly, the code is ready to be executed in any python terminal. 

## Using the project

This project should be used to analyze housing trends in the San Francisco area from 2010 - 2016. With the data vizualized, it's easy to
abalyze which houses cost the most per square foot, which houses have the highest gross rent prices, and what neighborhoods might be best to
invest in based on these numbers.
